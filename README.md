# Outstanding

> Yet another markdown-based note-taking app

## Goals

- **User-first** (put the "u" in "Outstanding")
  - Outstanding shouldn't get in the way of you, so no unnecessary limitations or confusing restrictions
  - Outstanding will be extensible from the beginning, with a registry and datapack system, so you can fully customise it to your needs
  - And of course, it's open-source, so you can freely inspect the source code and add features that aren't (yet) provided
- **Lots of formatting options**
  - Bold, italic, strikethrough just isn't flexible enough for everyday note-taking
  - Outstanding will give you the power to add semantic, flexible formatting with symbols (e.g. `++` for inserted test) and custom tags (e.g. `<ans>` for your answers to questions on a worksheet)
  - Ideally, you shouldn't feel more limited than you would if you were using a full word processor
- **Cross-platform**
  - Outstanding runs in the browser, making it accessible from practically any computer, even in locked-down environments
  - Outstanding should not just be mobile-friendly, but also Smart TV friendly, VR friendly, whatever
- **Compatible with other Markdown apps** (because no one's perfect)
  - Using Markdown as a text format gives Notability a great deal of interoperability for free, and we'll embrace this with support for various popular extensions to Markdown
  - Compatibility with [Notable](https://notable.app) will be a priority, so you can use either app as it suits you. As Notability gets more feature-rich there may be less and less reason to switch back to Notable, but your files will remain compatible both ways.
  - You should also be able to use Marp to turn your notes into presentations, Logseq to build a knowledge graph using them, or Jekyll to turn them into a simple website. Once again, Notability won't get in your way.
